Hello! I'm Ben; life-long technologist and tinkerer. Ever since I broke (and fixed) my dad's 386 I have been facinated with technology; leading to a career pursuing this passion. At home I enjoy home automation, gaming, 3d printing and general nerdom. Outside I enjoy motorcycles, running and hiking.
