Here are some of the courses, certifications I have pursued.

## [AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

Completed in 2017, this was my first stepping stone into cloud computing. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the "Cloud" and where the IT industry is heading as a whole.

## [Linux Academy / ACloudGuru](https://www.linuxacademy.com/)

I have been a Linux Academy subscriber for years now, and have completed the courses below. I highly recommend them for both business and personal use. I am even more enthusiastic about the platform now that they have merged with ACloudGuru
* LPI Linux Essentials
* Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer
* AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty
* AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional 2020
* Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate AZ-104
